# Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) Contract

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This project is a smart contract implementation of a basic Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) system using Solidity. It allows users to register with a referral address and rewards the referrer with a portion of the registration fee. The contract enforces one-level referral, and all transactions are stored on the blockchain to maintain transparency and trust.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
The vision of this project is to bring transparency, automation, and decentralization to MLM systems, which have historically been plagued by fraud and mismanagement. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to empower users and remove intermediaries from the process.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Secure registration with a valid referrer
- One-level referral system with 50% reward to the referrer
- On-chain tracking of user referrals and earnings
- Contract owner can withdraw unallocated funds
- Event logging for transparency (registration, rewards)
- Simple and efficient codebase for ease of deployment

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Multi-level referral chains with tiered rewards
- Referral tree visualization and analytics dashboard (DApp)
- Integration with stablecoins or other payment tokens
- Role-based admin management and anti-spam mechanisms
- Mobile app for easy onboarding and participation
- Community governance for parameter updates (e.g., fees, reward %)

- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- MetaMask (for DApp integration, optional)
